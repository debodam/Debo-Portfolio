          I'm currently a second-year engineering student at the Schulich School
          of Engineering, pursuing a major in Software Engineering and a minor
          in Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development. Some of my many
          interests include full-stack development, UI/UX design, business
          management and bionics/biotechnology. Through the next chapter in my
          life, I hope to further my contributions to the tech industry. Learn
